# Troubleshooting Guide

This document lists common setup and runtime issues that may occur when running **Brawl Stats v2**, along with their possible causes and solutions.

## 1. API Key not found

**Error message:**

```bash
‚ö†Ô∏è API_KEY doesn't found
```

**Cause:**  
The `BS_API_KEY` environment variable is missing or not loaded.

**Fix:**

1. Create a `.env` file inside `/api-proxy-server/`.
2. Add your Brawl Stars developer token:

   `BS_API_KEY=your_token_here`

3. Restart the backend:

   `npm run dev`

> üí° Remember: You must request your API key at [developer.brawlstars.com](https://developer.brawlstars.com/).  
> During registration, specify your **public IP address** (printed in the console when running the proxy server).

## 2. CORS not allowed by server

**Error message:**

```bash
Error: CORS not allowed by server
```

**Cause:**  
The frontend‚Äôs origin (e.g. `http://localhost:5173` or your deployed Vercel URL) is not included in `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.

**Fix:**

1. In `/api-proxy-server/.env`, define allowed origins:

```env
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app
```

2. Restart the backend server.

## 3. HTTP 429: Too Many Requests

**Error message:**

```yaml
HTTP 429: Too Many Requests
```

**Cause:**  
The rate limiter blocked requests because the limit was exceeded.

**Fix:**

- Wait for the cooldown period (typically 1 minute).
- Avoid spamming multiple requests (e.g. reloading the page repeatedly).
- During development, you can temporarily adjust the rate-limit configuration in  
   `/api-proxy-server/src/middlewares/rate-limit.ts`.

## 4. Frontend not connecting to backend

**Error message (browser console):**

```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/players/:tag net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
```

**Cause:**  
The backend is not running or the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` variable is incorrect.

**Fix:**

1. Ensure the backend is running:

```bash
cd api-proxy-server
npm run dev
```

2. In `/frontend/.env`, check that:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

3. Restart the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 5. Deployment environment mismatch (Render ‚Üî Vercel)

**Problem:**  
Frontend or backend URLs are hardcoded or misconfigured after deployment.

**Fix:**

- Make sure environment variables are consistent across both platforms:

| Platform          | Variable            | Example                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Render (backend)  | `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`   | `https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app`       |
| Vercel (frontend) | `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | `https://your-render-service.onrender.com` |

- Redeploy both apps after changes.

## 6. JSON parsing or undefined data in frontend

**Symptom:**  
Empty or ‚Äúundefined‚Äù UI values when loading player or club data.

**Cause:**  
The API response shape may differ or the tag input is invalid.

**Fix:**

- Ensure tags start with `#` (e.g. `#ABCD123`).
- Validate player or club existence directly in the [official API docs](https://developer.brawlstars.com/#/documentation).

## Quick checklist

‚úÖ `.env` files exist in both `/api-proxy-server` and `/frontend`.
‚úÖ Backend is running before frontend.
‚úÖ CORS configured correctly.
‚úÖ Public IP added to Brawl Stars developer portal.
‚úÖ Rate limit not exceeded.
‚úÖ Environment URLs match across Render and Vercel.
