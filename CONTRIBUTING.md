# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Brawl Stats v2**! ðŸŽ‰

This repository includes both a **frontend** (React + Vite + TypeScript) and a **backend** (Node + Express). Contributions are welcome for any part of the project.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. Create a branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

3. Make your changes and commit following best practices:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new feature X"
```

4. Ensure your code passes linting and tests:

5. Submit a **Pull Request** with a clear description of your changes.

## Code Style

- **Frontend** uses TypeScript, React, and ESLint with Vite defaults.
- **Backend** uses Node.js, Express, and commonly used libraries such as `dotenv`, `cors`, and `zod`. ESLint rules should be followed.
- Commit messages should follow **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)**.
- Maintain consistent file naming, folder structure, and code formatting.

## Issues

- To propose a new feature, open an **issue** and add the `enhancement` label.
