## How to Contribute

1. _Fork_ the repository and clone your fork.
2. Create a descriptive branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/<short-description>
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/<short-description>
   ```
3. Make small, atomic commits. Follow the [Commit Conventions](#commit-conventions).
4. Open a Pull Request against `main` when your change is ready.

---

## Recommended Workflow

- Work on branches prefixed with `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`, etc.
- Keep your branch up to date with `main` before opening a PR:
  ```bash
  git fetch origin
  git rebase origin/main
  ```
- If you add changes that affect the API (endpoints, types), document them in `docs/api/` or in `api-proxy-server/README.md`.

---

## Useful Scripts

**Frontend**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev     # development (Vite)
npm run build   # production build
npm run lint    # lint with ESLint
```

**Backend (api-proxy-server)**

```bash
cd api-proxy-server
npm install
npm run dev     # build + node dist/index.js (as defined in package.json)
npm run build
```

> Note: if your environment uses a specific `NODE_VERSION`, indicate it in `.nvmrc` or in the documentation. If you‚Äôd like, we can include it.

---

## Commit Conventions

We follow **Conventional Commits**. Examples:

- `feat(frontend): add PlayerModal component`
- `fix(api): handle 429 errors from /players endpoint`
- `docs: update CONTRIBUTING.md`

This makes changelogs and reviews much easier.
